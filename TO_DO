5.1.4



BEFORE 4.4:
- mixed attributes and delays.
- write infinite terms
- fix restore when code is moved around.
- document new interface functions.
- mask when installing.
- reports from Nicos.
- fix ensure_loaded/1.

STK:
- move architecture #ifdef's out of C files.
- collapse windows and POSIX makefile recipes.
- inline c_interface functions (static #included?)
- look for a system regexp library before using the one in Yap.
- see why tag2.pl is not compiling.
- make docs/Makefile configurable.
- break up yap.tex.
- start devel.tex.
- should sigactions be executed when Yap is waiting at the prompt?
- see if on_signal/3 works through the C interface as well.
- current_signal/3 does not know the SigId.
- see how MPI libraries interact with YAP's signal handling.
- atomic (as opposed or to numerical) tags (and communicators).
- configure.in:236: check for mpicc in the user's prefix, if any
 
TO CHECK:
- bad register allocation for a(X,Y) :- X is Y+2.3 ?

TABLING
- pass all tabling tests from Kostis and Bart paper
- handle floats, long ints and friends in tables.
- backtracking over mutable and tabling does not work (ai_tests).

PARALLELISM
- copying: Fix stack copying after new stack.
- SBA: fix constraint and unification.
- IAP.

AFTER 4.4(?)

- threads.

DONE:
- compilation of bignums.

- read inf, nan, improve print_message.
- Too large term in copy_term.
- block.
- include Stasinos patches for gmp configuration and documentation.
- debug new code for delays
- debug new code for attributes.
- bug in CHR, run3, deussen1(X).
- functor
- check how terms are written by debugger

- system enters loop if predicate exported by module is not defined. 
- copying garbage collector: implemented hybrid
- dif example in Manual.
- initial port to OS_X
- listing (Steve Moyle).

- fix bugs from Nicos.
- remove pl/nfr.yap and misc/yap.spec from CVS.
- deterministic trail entries for multi-assignment variables.
- weird going ons with prompt and readline
- check library(random)
- document system(library)
- interrupt handling in WIN32
- ^C can break code.
- system library
