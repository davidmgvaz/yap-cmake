INSTALL
*******

   To correctly install PiLLoW, first, make sure you downloaded the
right version of PiLLoW (there are different versions for different
LP/CLP systems; the version that comes with Ciao is of course the
right one for Ciao). Then, please follow these steps:

  1. Copy the files in the `images' directory to a WWW accessible
     directory in your server.

  2. Edit the file `icon_address.pl' and change the fact to point to
     the URL to be used to access the images above.

  3. In the Ciao system the files are in the correct place, in other
     systems copy the files `pillow.pl' and `icon_address.pl' to a
     suitable directory so that your Prolog system will find them.
