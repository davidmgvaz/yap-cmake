Getting the Package
===================

   The latest version of the Package is available at
`http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/'.

   The SWI-Prolog version of PiLLoW needs the `clib' package for the
HTTP conection facilities. It is available from
`http://swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/SWI-Prolog/packages/clib/'

Directory map
=============

   In the distribution you should find the following subdirectories:
`doc'
     contains an article in different formats explaining Web
     programming in PiLLoW, and in non-Ciao distributions (in Ciao
     the PiLLoW manual is inside the Ciao manual) the manual in three
     formats: in GNU info in `pillow_doc.info', suitable for
     consulting in the emacs editor; in Postscript in
     `pillow_doc.ps', for printing in a Postscript printer or
     visualizing with `ghostview' or similar program; and in HTML
     inside the directory `pillow_doc_html'.

`examples'
     contains programming examples, prepared to run in the Ciao
     system, but easily adaptable to other Logic Programming systems.

`images'
     contains images used by the PiLLoW library or the examples.
