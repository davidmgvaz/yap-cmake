======================= README (src/prolog) ======================

This directory contains the Prolog source files of the PRISM part,
along with a minimal set of source files from B-Prolog, required
to build the PRISM system.  It is assumed that the compilation is
done on Linux, Mac OS X or Cygwin and that GNU make is used.

  Makefile   ... Makefile
  Compile.sh ... auxiliary shell script called by Makefile
  core/      ... base components of the PRISM's Prolog part
  trans/     ... translator from PRISM to Prolog
  up/        ... probabilistic inferences
  mp/        ... parallel EM learning
  bp/        ... source file(s) from B-Prolog 

`up' and `mp' stands for uni-processor and multi-processor,
respectively.  The source code of the First Order Compiler is
not available, and currently we have no plan for releasing it
to public.


[How to compile the Prolog part]

  Since the compiled code of the C part is used for the compilation
  of the Prolog part, please make compilation and installation at
  $(TOP)/src/c/ (for instruction, please see README in the directory)
  in advance.

  Then, just type at the shell:

    make

  The compiled byte code will be installed (copied) into $(TOP)/bin
  by typing:

    make install

  You can clean up the compiled byte codes by:

    make clean
