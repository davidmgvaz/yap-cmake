========================== README (src) ==========================

This directory contains the source files of the PRISM part, along
with a minimal set of source and binary files from B-Prolog,
required to build the PRISM system:

  c/      ... C code 
  prolog/ ... Prolog code

Please use/modify/distribute the source code based on the license
agreements described $(TOP)/LICENSE and $(TOP)/LICENSE.src, where
$(TOP) is the top directory in the unfolded package.

To build the PRISM system, we need to compile both C and Prolog
source files.  Please follow the instructions described in READMEs
at the `c' and `prolog' directories.
